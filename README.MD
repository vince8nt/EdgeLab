## Core Graph API

- **Graph:** Efficient CSR format graph.
    - **num_vertices():** Returns the number of vertices (densely packed) in the graph.
    - **num_edges():** Returns the number of edges in the graph (accounts for directed/undirected).
    - **Iteration/Indexing:** Exposes a `VertexRef` type for access via iteration and/or indexing.
    - **Printing:** The graph can be printed to a stream for debugging using the `<<` operator.
- **VertexRef:** An 8-byte struct for efficient passing by value.
    - **num_edges():** The number of outgoing edges from this vertex.
    - **Iteration/Indexing:** Exposes an `EdgeType` for access via iteration and/or indexing.
    - **has_edge_to(vertex):** Determines if the directed edge exists in O(log num_edges).
    - **edge_to(vertex):** Returns an `EdgeType` iterator or `end()` in O(log num_edges).
    - **weight():** Returns the weight or `1.0` for graphs with unweighted vertices.
    - **data():** Returns the optional custom data associated with the given vertex.
- **EdgeType:**
    - **weight():** Returns the weight or `1.0` for graphs with unweighted edges.
    - **data():** Returns the optional custom data associated with the given edge.

### CLI & Dispatch

- **CLI (src/cli.h):** Command-line interface for specifying generator options (graph type, vertex/edge type, scale, degree, generator type) or file loading options.
- **Dispatching (src/cli_dispatch.h):** Generic dispatch system for instantiating templated functions via CLI options. This allows users to write graph algorithms generalized for any combination of Vertex/Edge/Graph type, without any runtime overhead.

## Building and Usage

### Prerequisites

- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 12+, MSVC 2019+)
- CMake 3.16+ (for build system)
- OpenCL SDK (optional, for GPU acceleration)

### Build & Run

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
# generate graph and run algorithm
./verify_undirected --graph-type undirected --vertex-type unweighted --edge-type unweighted --scale 20 --degree 5 --gen-type erdos_renyi

# load graph from file and run algorithm
./bfs_opencl --load-graph ../graphs/mini.el
```

**Note:** OpenCL support is optional. If OpenCL is not found, the build will succeed but the algorithms in `examples_opencl` will not be compiled. The system provides graceful fallback for environments without OpenCL support.

---

### Custom Data Types

Template support for storing Vertex/Edge data within the CLI structure for improved cache locality:

```cpp
struct VertexData { short count; int priority; };
struct EdgeData { int traversals; double reliability; };
using CustomGraph = Graph<VertexWD<VertexData>, EdgeWD<EdgeData>, GraphType::DIRECTED>;
```

---

### Graph Traversal

```cpp
// Traverse via indexing
for (vertex_ID_t u = 0; u < graph.num_vertices(); ++u) {
    for (vertex_ID_t i = 0; i < graph[v].size(); i++) {
        // graph[v][i].dest(), graph[v][i].weight(), etc.
    }
}
```

```cpp
// Traverse via iteration
for (auto vertexRef : graph) {
    for (const auto& edge : vertexRef) {
        // edge.dest(), edge.weight(), etc.
    }
}
```

---

### OpenCL GPU Acceleration

The library includes GPU-accelerated algorithms using OpenCL:

```cpp
// OpenCL BFS implementation
template<typename Vertex_t, typename Edge_t, GraphType Graph_t>
long long breadth_first_search_opencl(Graph<Vertex_t, Edge_t, Graph_t>& graph, 
                                     vertex_ID_t src, vertex_ID_t dest);
```

**Features:**
- Automatic CSR format conversion for GPU memory
- Level-synchronous BFS with parallel edge exploration
- Device information and work group size optimization
- Graceful error handling and resource cleanup

---

## Testing & CI

- **Automated CI:** GitHub Actions workflow builds and tests all binaries, fails on warnings, and checks exit codes.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Build system gracefully handles systems with and without OpenCL support.
- **OpenCL Testing:** GPU-accelerated algorithms are tested when OpenCL is available.

---

## Current Limitations

- Some graph generation algorithms (e.g., Watts-Strogatz) are planned but not yet implemented.
- Only unweighted/weighted (not data-carrying) types are fully supported in the CLI dispatch system.
- OpenCL BFS currently supports unweighted graphs only (weighted edge support planned).
- GPU memory management is currently not flexible for all combinations of Vertex/Edge/Graph type.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Additional graph generation algorithms
- [ ] More graph analysis algorithms (shortest paths, connectivity, etc.)
- [ ] More graph I/O formats (GraphML, GEXF, etc.)
- [ ] Memory pool optimization for large graphs
- [ ] Additional OpenCL algorithms (SSSP, PageRank, etc.)
- [ ] Weighted edge support for OpenCL BFS
- [ ] Multi-GPU support for distributed graph processing
- [ ] CUDA backend as alternative to OpenCL
